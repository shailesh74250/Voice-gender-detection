voice gender detection using GMM
There is a lot of information that can be extracted from a speech sample, for example - who is the speaker, what is the gender of the speaker, what is the language being spoken, with what emotion has the speaker spoken the sentence, the number of speakers in the conversation, etc.
In the feild of speech analytics with machine learning, gender detection is perhaps the most foundational task. 

Training corpus: It has been developed from YouTube videos and consists of 5 minutes of speech for each gender, spoken by 5 distinct male and 5 female speakers (i.e, 1 minute/speaker).
